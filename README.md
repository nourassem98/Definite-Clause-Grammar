# Definite-Clause-Grammars
A parser for a Definite Clause Grammar of English-Light using Prolog.
English-Light is a fragment of English (i.e., English-Light does not include any ungrammatical English sentences).

To run my code :

	1- To check the parse tree of a sentence :
		s(T,[the,young,boy,pushed,and,stored,a,big,box,in,the,large,empty,room,after,school],[]).

	
	2- To check if a sentence is grammatically correct:
		s([who,climbed,the,big,tree],[]).
